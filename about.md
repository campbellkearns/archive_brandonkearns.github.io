<h2>Hello! I am Brandon Kearns</h2>
<div>    
    <h5><strong>Background<br></strong></h5>
    <p>I am a web developer with a passion for travel. I was born in North Carolina and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After graduating with a political science degree, I went to Korea to teach English for a year. I returned to the United States in 2012 and spent a year in the northeast which culminated in the completion of my first marathon in Washington, DC. Since then, I have been enjoying some of the things that Atlanta has to offer.</p>

    <h5><strong>Motivations<br></strong></h5>    
    <p>I am looking to apply the skills that I learned with General Assembly at a place that allows me to grow personally and continue to develop professionally. Web development is something that I am working hard to learn and I appreciate the challenge that it provides. I am inspired by the impact that innovative and thoughful web development can have on the lives of people with internet access around the world.</p>
